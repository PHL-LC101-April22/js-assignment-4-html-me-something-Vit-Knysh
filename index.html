            <h2>First meeting with PC</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I got my first PC in 1995. I was so excited.
               And of course first that I did on it - install few games and start playing, when I have some time.
               Playing games I had to learn how to fix some issues - when game just stuck and didn`t give any response.
               So I learnd  how to managed running programs.</p>

            <p>The time went on and I had to add additional RAM, as my PC started to be slow :).
               And I learnd differences in RAM and how to install it in PC.
               And add additional HDD as well.</p>
